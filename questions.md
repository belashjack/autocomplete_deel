1. What is the difference between Component and PureComponent? give an
example where it might break my app.

PureComponent is performing "shallow compare" of props, thus allowing to opt-out of rendering process. We can do the same using `shouldComponentUpdate` function.

It should not break our app unless we mutate state or props. However, it can cause performance degradation because premature optimizations is never a good thing.

that?

Contexts just doesn't pay attention to shouldComponentUpdate

8. How many arguments does setState take and why is it async.

Two argument, first either function or object, second is callback. It is async because of performance optimizations.

9. List the steps needed to migrate a Class to Function Component.
